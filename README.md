# 3MF (3D Manufacturing Format) support for Rust

## About

This library provides support for [3MF] files to programs written in the Rust programming language. So far, functionality is limited to writing 3MF files, and only the most basic features of 3MF are supported.

Adding support for reading 3MF files, and for more features of the 3MF format is very desirable, and any contributions toward that are very welcome.

## Status

Functionality is limited, but what is currently there seems to work well. This library is used by (and has been extracted from) [Fornjot].
